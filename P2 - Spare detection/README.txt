Part 2: Using the External Dataset for Training and Evaluation

In this section, we have two files:

  - 'emails.csv': This file contains the dataset provided by Gaggle, which is used for both training and evaluating the model.
 
  - 'spare_detection_model.ipynb': This script is consist the model code.
    Designed to be easily run in Google Colab, making it convenient for users to replicate the training process. 
    Additionally, you can use this code to test the model with your own personal emails.
